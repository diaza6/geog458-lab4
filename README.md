## Modified Basemap

![Basemap](screenshots/basemap.png "Screenshot of basemap")

In these tiles, the available zoom levels are 1-14. This examines the Seattle
area. I made the basemap dark, changed some of the fonts, and made the water
a dark blue.

## Police Stations

![Police Stations](screenshots/police-stations.png "Screenshot of police stations")

In these tiles, the available zoom levels are 1-14. This examines the Seattle
area. It uses a light basemap and shows the locations of each police
station in the Seattle area. Each station is represented by a red dot.

## Modified Basemap + Police Stations

![Modified Basemap + Police Stations](screenshots/together.png "Screenshot of basemap with police stations")

In these tiles, the available zoom levels are 1-14. This examines the Seattle
area. It overlays the police station locations over the modified basemap I created.

## Nature

![Nature](screenshots/nature.png "Screenshot of nature")

In these tiles, the available zoom levels are 1-14. This examines the Seattle
area. The theme is nature so I made the basemap green, the water blue, changed the fonts
for nature areas, and made national parks a darker green.
